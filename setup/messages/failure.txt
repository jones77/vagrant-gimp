FAILURE - Vagrant bootstrapping failed
                                                                     
The development environment setup has failed somehow.  You have three options to
resolve this issue.                                      
                                                                   
1) Delete your bootstrapped environment and restart the entire process.  To do
   that execute the following commands.                                
       vagrant destroy                                                   
       vagrant up                                                       
                                                                       
2) Try to rerun the setup script again without deleting all of your   
   progress.  To do that execute the following commands.             
       vagrant ssh                                                  
       /build/everything.sh                                        
                                                                             
3) File an issue and include the error log leading up to the failure.  To   
   file an issue visit: FIXME
